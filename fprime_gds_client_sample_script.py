""" Print each instance of a given channel by name

A sample script showing GDS scripting usage. This script sets up an argument of channel-name, a data handler that
receives channels and filters to that channel-name then printing it.  Running will yield a print-out for each time the
channel is received. e.g.

2023-07-19 18:59:20: blockDrv.BD_Cycles = 1275
2023-07-19 18:59:22: blockDrv.BD_Cycles = 1277
2023-07-19 18:59:24: blockDrv.BD_Cycles = 1279
2023-07-19 18:59:26: blockDrv.BD_Cycles = 1281
2023-07-19 18:59:28: blockDrv.BD_Cycles = 1283

This script is designed to connect to the GDS system using standard GDS arguments. It is a GDS client.
